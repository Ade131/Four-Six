## What is the 4:6 Method?

The 4:6 method, created by Tetsu Kasuya, provides a simple and adjustable way to brew pourover coffee. The method is named after its water-pouring strategy: 40% of the water is poured in the first stage to bloom the coffee, followed by the remaining 60% in the second stage. This allows users to customize the strength and flavor of their coffee easily.
